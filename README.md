Crappy chess engine

This is a really weak chess engine developed as a hobby with the intention of making it really simple, it's strength make's it ideal for beginners.  
It has a randomness setting expressed in centipawns (a random move within the randomness range of the best move found will be played).  
It's a resource itensive program. Default search depth is set to 3 ply, any more than that will take a lot of time.  
To use it you'll need a GUI. Basically any chess program will do. I recommend Banksia GUI https://banksiagui.com/ that's available for Linux and Windows, can configure engine settings and have a nice interface.
